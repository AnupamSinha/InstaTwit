Thanks HeadFirst Teams for the excellent book ...... simply loving it.

Being new in Objective C, I tried finding a sample code to understand Xcode & Objective C . But my serach was in Vain.
Thus for the open source community i have created a sample code, which i will be working on and upgrading it with time.

Thanks in Advance for your suggestion.
